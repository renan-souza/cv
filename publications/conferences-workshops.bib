	abstract = {Computational  Science  and  Engineering  (CSE) projects are typically developed by multidisciplinary teams. Despite being part of the same project, each team manages its own workflows, using  specific  execution  environments  and  data processingtools. Analyzing the data processed by all workflows globally is a core task in a CSE project. However, this analysis ishard because the data generated by these workflows are not integrated. In addition, since these workflows may take a long time to execute, data analysis needs to be done at runtime to reduce cost and time of the CSE project. A typical solution in scientific data analysis is to capture and relate the data in a provenance database while the workflows run, thus allowing for data analysisat runtime. However, the main problem is that such data capture competes with the running workflows, adding significant overhead to their execution. To mitigate this problem, we introduce in this paper a system called ProvLake, which adopts design principles for providing efficientdistributed data capture from the workflows. While capturing the data, ProvLake logically integrates and ingests them into a provenance database ready for analysesat runtime. We validated  ProvLake ina  real  use  case  in  the  O&G  industry encompassingfour workflows that process 5TB datasets for a deep learning classifier. Compared with Komadu, the closest solution that meets our goals, our approach enables runtime multiworkflow data analysis with much smaller overhead, such as 0.1\%.}

    abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) has become essential in several industries. In Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), the complexity of the ML lifecycle comes from the large variety of data, scientists' expertise, tools, and workflows. If data are not tracked properly during the lifecycle, it becomes unfeasible to recreate a ML model from scratch or to explain to stakeholders how it was created. The main limitation of provenance tracking solutions is that they cannot cope with provenance capture and integration of domain and ML data processed in the multiple workflows in the lifecycle while keeping the provenance capture overhead low. To handle this problem, in this paper we contribute with a detailed characterization of provenance data in the ML lifecycle in CSE; a new provenance data representation, called PROV-ML, built on top of W3C PROV and ML Schema; and extensions to a system that tracks provenance from multiple workflows to address the characteristics of ML and CSE, and to allow for provenance queries with a standard vocabulary. We show a practical use in a real case in the Oil and Gas industry, along with its evaluation using 48 GPUs in parallel.}
